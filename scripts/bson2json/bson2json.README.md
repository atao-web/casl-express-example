bson to json
==============

Simple utility which converts bson files to json files using *Mongo* `bsondump`.

The `bsondump` converts BSON files into human-readable formats, including JSON. For example, `bsondump` is useful for reading the output files generated by `mongodump`.

Starting in version 4.2, `bsondump` uses Extended JSON v2.0 (Canonical mode) to format its data.

JSON can only directly represent a subset of the types supported by BSON. To preserve type information, MongoDB adds extensions to the JSON format. One of them is the Canonical Mode:

        A string format that emphasizes type preservation at the expense of readability and interoperability. That is, conversion from canonical to BSON will generally preserve type information except in certain specific cases.

This format conforms to the [JSON RFC](http://www.json.org/) and can be parsed by the various MongoDB drivers and tools.

## Usage

### As a Command Line tool

`bsondump` must be available from the system path.

~~~
ts-node bson2json.ts <filepath1> <filepath2> [...]

Or

~~~
export FILE_LIST=(<filepath1> <filepath2> [...])
ts-node bson2json.ts
